# API Service

---

This service has written using `axios` without any other libs.

## Usage:

#### Post Requests:

```js
const response = await httpClient.post("YOUR_END_POINT", { data: { foo: bar } });
```

#### Get Requests:

```js
const response = yield httpClient.get("YOUR_END_POINT")
```

**Note**
We are moving the apis to react-query, please consider reading its documentation.

**Note**
You need to use `yield` instead of `await` in Generator functions like `Sagas`
