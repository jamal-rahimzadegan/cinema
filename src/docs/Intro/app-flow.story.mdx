2. On the details page, click next.
3. Now you can search and select the `cinema` and the `sans`.
4. Enter `ticket info` (name, etc.)
5. Select the seat by `clicking` on the seat list and the opened `popup` (you can zoom it).
6. On the last page, if the seat is `still not reserved`, you can pay (also check the info)
