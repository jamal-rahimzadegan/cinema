# Sentry

---

Sentry enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions. For more information visit the [Documentation]("https://docs.sentry.io/").

### Install & Configure

You need to install `@sentry/browser` from [sentry/browser]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/browser").

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application, and you need to initiate it.

The best place for initiating is inside the `index.js`

---

#### How To Initiate?

Get the `DSN` from: `Sentry Dashboard > Settings > Client Keys (DSN)`, and then use it when you initiate Sentry like below:

-   Better to store `DSNs` inside the `.env` files.

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
	dsn: "", // DSN value from sentry dashboard (client keys)
});
```

---

**Note:**
The installed version of Sentry inside the project must be the same as the server version.
